\description{
Function to (heuristically) test for a network connection by attempting
to connect to a given website.
}
\details{
The main page of Google is used as a proxy for overall network
connectivity as Google is generally 'network-close' and the page
is relatively small.  If a network is unavailable this fails
generally already on domain name service resolution. Special thanks
to Barry and Brodie for a very helpful discussion re-discovering this
function.
